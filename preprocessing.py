def scale(X, axis=0, with_mean=True, with_std=True, copy=True):
    """Standardize a dataset along any axis
    Center to the mean and component wise scale to unit variance.
    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <preprocessing_scaler>`.
    Parameters
    ----------
    X : {array-like, sparse matrix}
        The data to center and scale.
    axis : int (0 by default)
        axis used to compute the means and standard deviations along. If 0,
        independently standardize each feature, otherwise (if 1) standardize
        each sample.
    with_mean : boolean, True by default
        If True, center the data before scaling.
    with_std : boolean, True by default
        If True, scale the data to unit variance (or equivalently,
        unit standard deviation).
    copy : boolean, optional, default True
        set to False to perform inplace row normalization and avoid a
        copy (if the input is already a numpy array or a scipy.sparse
        CSC matrix and if axis is 1).
    Notes
    -----
    This implementation will refuse to center scipy.sparse matrices
    since it would make them non-sparse and would potentially crash the
    program with memory exhaustion problems.
    Instead the caller is expected to either set explicitly
    `with_mean=False` (in that case, only variance scaling will be
    performed on the features of the CSC matrix) or to call `X.toarray()`
    if he/she expects the materialized dense array to fit in memory.
    To avoid memory copy the caller should pass a CSC matrix.
    For a comparison of the different scalers, transformers, and normalizers,
    see :ref:`examples/preprocessing/plot_all_scaling.py
    <sphx_glr_auto_examples_preprocessing_plot_all_scaling.py>`.
